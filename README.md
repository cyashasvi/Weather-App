# Weather-App
This app's functionality is to show someone a five day forecast of any city they are interested in, and then show them
the five day forecast showing the weather, humidity, and the UV index. 
To build this app, I had to:
1. Create elements such as:
    a. cards to hold the forecasts
    b. jumbotron to show today's temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV Index.
    c. a search bar with a button to actually run the search.
    d. a small card to hold the value of the city you just typed.
2. Run two Fetch functions to bring in the OpenWeather API to pull data.
3. Dynamically generate data onto the page from API.
4. Move city into localstorage. 

Although this app didn't have all the functionalities described in my assignment, I was still able to get the application
to work for the most part.
